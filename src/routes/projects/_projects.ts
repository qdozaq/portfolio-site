      A new spin on the classic game of Snake.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Really wanted to do a project using <em>react-three-fiber</em> and the pandemic
      gave me a good opportunity to finally play with it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Original idea was simple, what if the game <em>Snake</em> was on a 3D cube? This project was filled
      with challenges and interesting problems across design, programming and user experience
      and was a great intro to learning a really cool library.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This project was also nominated for the 2020 React OSAwards <em>"Fun Side Project of the Year"</em>.

      Besides creating a centralized hub for everything me I really wanted to
      push myself to create a site that utilizes all my skills both as a developer and motion designer.
      This site focuses on strong typography, seemless motion, and performance with near perfect lighthouse scores.
